      <h2>1. What is difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>
        <b>LocalStorage:</b> Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an
        improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
        Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a
        typical 4KB cookie. The data is not sent back to the server for every
        HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount
        of traffic between client and server. The data stored in localStorage
        persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available
        for all current and future visits to the site​
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>sessionStorage:</b> It is similar to localStorage. Changes are only
        available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox).
        Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as
        future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed,
        the storage is deleted The data is available only inside the window/tab
        in which it was set​

      <h2>2.What is difference between global scope vs Local scoop?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Global scope</strong> variables can use within the program
        anyware. Global variables are declaring outside any functions. <br />
        <strong>Local scope </strong> variable value is only for that particular
        scope (function).Local variables are declaring inside that particular
        function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <code>
        var fVariable = "Hello World"; //Global Scope Declaration <br />
        function printjs() { <br />
        var sVariable = "Welcome"; //Local Scope Declaration
        console.log(sVariable); <br />
        console.log(fVariable); <br />
        } <br /><br />
        printjs(); <br />
        console.log(fVariable);<br />
      </code>
      <p>
        Here you cannot print the value of sVariable outside the function as it
        is a local variable. But you can print the value of fVariable outside
        and inside both of the function as it is a global variable

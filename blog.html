      <h2>1. What is difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>
        <b>LocalStorage:</b> Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an
        improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity.
        Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a
        typical 4KB cookie. The data is not sent back to the server for every
        HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount
        of traffic between client and server. The data stored in localStorage
        persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available
        for all current and future visits to the site​
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>sessionStorage:</b> It is similar to localStorage. Changes are only
        available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox).
        Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as
        future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed,
        the storage is deleted The data is available only inside the window/tab
        in which it was set​

      <h2>2.What is difference between global scope vs Local scoop?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>Global scope</strong> variables can use within the program
        anyware. Global variables are declaring outside any functions. <br />
        <strong>Local scope </strong> variable value is only for that particular
        scope (function).Local variables are declaring inside that particular
        function.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <code>
        var fVariable = "Hello World"; //Global Scope Declaration <br />
        function printjs() { <br />
        var sVariable = "Welcome"; //Local Scope Declaration
        console.log(sVariable); <br />
        console.log(fVariable); <br />
        } <br /><br />
        printjs(); <br />
        console.log(fVariable);<br />
      </code>
      <p>
        Here you cannot print the value of sVariable outside the function as it
        is a local variable. But you can print the value of fVariable outside
        and inside both of the function as it is a global variable

      <h2>3.How javascript works event loop?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>
        The <strong>event loop</strong> is the secret behind JavaScript’s
        asynchronous programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread,
        but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
        multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
      </p>
      <p>
        The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in
        line to be executed. Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from
        the stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack
        for processing. It follows the queue data structure to maintain the
        correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for execution
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These
        are APIs built into the browser. Based on the command received from the
        call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded operation. An example
        of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is
        processed in the stack, it is sent to the corresponding API which waits
        till the specified time to send this operation back in for processing.
        Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a
        cyclic system for running async operations in JavaScript. The language
        itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as separate threads.
        The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or
        not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions are added
        from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is
        processed.

      <h2>4.How many undefined can you get in javascript?</h2>
      <h4>Answer:</h4>
      <p>Total 3 types of undefined can we get in javascript</p>
      <p>
        Undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable
        in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value
        undefined. In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable,
        non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding
        it.) A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined.
        A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is
        being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
        undefined if a value was not returned.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>i.Strict equality and undefined</h5>
      <p>
        You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators
        to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the
        variable x is not initialized, and the if statement evaluates to true.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>ii.Typeof operator and undefined</h5>
      <p>
        Typeof is generally always guaranteed to return a string for any operand
        it is supplied with. Even with undeclared identifiers, typeof will
        return "undefined" instead of throwing an error
      </p>
      <br />
      <h6>iii.Void operator and undefined</h6>
      <p>
        JavaScript has a unary void operator. It evaluates the given expression
        and then returns undefined.
